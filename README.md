# yagpdb-cc
Custom Commands I make for my Discords running YAGPDB

In this repository are some CC's I made. I am not a very good programmer, and anything here that I made by myself will work, but is very simple. If you are trying to learn YAG CC's, which is a vrey useful skill to have, I reccommend you try and make some by yourself.
