This group of CCs was an attempt to fix an issue with the included mute system. It allows you to silently mute members of a
channel without any other members seeing. The most they would see is the trigger briefly on the screen before the custom command
deletes it.

Reasons are already preset and there is no argument for a reason in any of these.
