The VerifyLog CC was made when we migrated from YAG's own DM verification to a rolemenu verification, however, we still wanted to log. So, I made a CC to log when a reaction was added. This can be applied to any reaftion in any channel.

Settings

$msgID: ID of the message containing the reaction
$oe: Reaction you want to monitor
$log: channel to send log events to
$MemberRole: Role name of the role the reaction adds. This prevents users who have already verified from creating a log event.

Set the trigger to reaction (added reactions only).
