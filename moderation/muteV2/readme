This group of CCs was an attempt to fix an issue with the included mute system. It allows you to silently mute members of a
channel without any other members seeing. The most they would see is the trigger briefly on the screen before the custom command
deletes it.

Reasons are already preset and there is no argument for a reason in any of these. You may also just whitelist the command for your staff
role, however, you will still have to enter the role name into the configuration variables.

Variables to set:
Mute
$staff is your Staff role, anybody with this role will have permissions to use this command

Tempmute
$staff is your Staff role, anybody with this role will have permissions to use this command
$uCCID is the ID of your unmute custom command

Unmute
$staff is your Staff role, anybody with this role will have permissions to use this command

Mute v2 1.0
