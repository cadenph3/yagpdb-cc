This giveaway system was not originally created by me, but has been modified.

Originally, the command included a required -c argument to specify what channel you wish to use. 

I have changed this to a permanant configuration option as I personally only ever used one channel. It also tags @everyone with a message containing the prize for each giveaway. 

Original: Jo3-L/yagpdb-cc
License for the source code contained is included.

For the giveaway CC, reccommended trigger is "giveaway" but you can use whatever you want.

For the reaction CC, set the trigger to reaction (Added or removed).
