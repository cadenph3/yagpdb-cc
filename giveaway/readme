This giveaway system was not originally created by me, but has been modified.

Originally, the command included a required -c argument to specify what channel you wish to use. 

I have changed this to a permanant configuration option as I personally only ever used one channel. It also tags @everyone with a message containing the prize for each giveaway.

The original author has many custom commands in the repository listed, and you should check him out.

For the giveaway CC, use trigger "giveaway".

For the reaction CC, set the trigger to reaction (Added or removed).

You can edit the emoji to be used as a reaction. Make sure you change this setting in both CCs if you wish to change from the default.

This CC is forever evolving as I learn more about the Custom Command enviornment and programming in general. All work done by me in this command comprises of simple additions.
